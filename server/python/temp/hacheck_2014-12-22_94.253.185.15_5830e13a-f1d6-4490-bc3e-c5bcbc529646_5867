Moscow (CNN) -- President Vladimir Putin s news conferences aren t at all like news conferences I used to attend in Washington, when I covered the White House.  First, there are the stuffed animals. Since there are more than 1,200 journalists in the giant hall, they have to attract President Putin s attention some way, so some bring stuffed animals, raise home-made signs, or wear T-shirts specially printed up to advertise the region or news organization they come from.  Then there s the length of the conference. This one was the usual length -- three and a half hours. Others have been longer.  This was Vladimir Putin s 10th news conference and it couldn t have happened at a worse time. As the Russians say, the smell of kerosene was in the air. The value of the Russian currency, the ruble, was dropping like a stone, the U.S. and Europe were just announcing yet more sanctions, Russia was on the verse of a recession, but the president refused to call it a "crisis."  Striding into the hall, Putin appeared cool, calm and collected. Close-ups of the president s face were broadcast on two giant screens on either side of the hall, his every glance, every gesture visible.  Putin s first challenge was to assure his fellow citizens that Russia can overcome what he called an "unfavorable scenario" and he promised that would happen -- in two years, maybe less.
